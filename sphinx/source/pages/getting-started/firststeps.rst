First Steps
===========

After installing/including in your project, before using PySimpleFrame it requires initialization
because of the :ref:`_interface-package` module

In your main application initialization, initialize like this:

.. code-block:: python
   
   pysimpleframe.Initialize()

This will start anything that pysimpleframe needs to run to be prepared for your project usage

.. note:: PySimpleFrame Initialization only needs to be ran once per application instance
